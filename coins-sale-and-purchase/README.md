# Paytrie Project - Coins sale and purchase

The Paytrie project consists of two components: the Paytrie Widget and the Paytrie Website. The Paytrie Widget is an embeddable component designed for buying and selling different types of coins, featuring registration and user verification steps. The Paytrie Website serves as a platform to display coin details and embed the Paytrie Widget.

## Highlights

- **Paytrie Widget:** Developed an embeddable widget allowing users to buy and sell various coins with registration and user verification steps embedded directly into external websites.
  
- **Paytrie Website:** Created a platform to display detailed information about coins and embed the Paytrie Widget for seamless coin transactions.

## Technologies

- **ReactJS:** A declarative and efficient JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Used as the foundation for the widget.
  
- **TypeScript:** A strongly typed programming language that enhances code quality and maintainability in both frontend and backend development.
  
- **Radix UI (Shadcn):** A set of low-level UI primitives for React, contributing to a consistent and accessible design system.
  
- **TailwindCSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level utility classes for building designs directly in your markup, offering flexibility and ease of styling.
  
- **Zustand:** A small, fast, and scalable state management library for React applications. Used for managing the widget's state.

- **Dark Mode:** Implemented dark mode using TailwindCSS to provide users with a comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments.
