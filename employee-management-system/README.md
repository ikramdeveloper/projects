# Employee Management System (EMS)

A project developed for efficient employee administration within organizations. EMS simplifies attendance tracking, leave applications, and payroll management using the MERN stack. Additionally, I've also built backend (NodeJS) for mobile application, providing employees with a user-friendly interface to apply for leave and access their leave and salary records.

- **Redux:** Implementing a predictable state container to manage the application's state for seamless data flow.

- **Bitbucket:** Employing Bitbucket for version control, facilitating collaborative development and efficient code management.

- **Heroku:** Deploying the backend on Heroku for reliable and scalable hosting, ensuring seamless accessibility.

- **Netlify:** Hosting the frontend on Netlify to deliver a fast and secure user experience, enhancing overall performance.
